**Some Notes:**  I got inspiration for this schema from a Stack Overflow post.  The OP mentions some of the data entities, but leaves out a lot of information except for the targeted REPORT output when users query the data schema.  The post described a problem which needed several many-to-one relationships detailed within its table structures.  This is my suggestion on how to manage them. 

> There is also an accompanying Oracle Application Express (APEX) app that has some basic edit and add features so that a user can easily see how the data goes into this schema and how to see the relationships between the data values in each detail report.
