uglysql
=======

A database programmer's treasury of useful and (sometimes) ugly SQL query scripts intended to educate and assist people who are studying and learning SQL and database programming.

**... Actually, the name "ugly" is not entirely accurate. I have enjoyed many years of discovering ways to apply SQL in the area of understanding the use of databases for challenging problems.** 

## Getting Started
Be sure to check out the [project wiki site](https://github.com/richardpascual/uglysql/wiki) for this project to get more information on how to use the resources made available at this GitHub project.  There is also a [blog](http://uglysql.com) for additional commentary and periodic articles on topics on SQL and programming for databases.

## Conventions and Versions
These tutorials were written with ORACLE database in mind although some (but not all) of the code samples provided in this project will work in almost any relational database management system (RDBMS) with minimal or no additional adaptions.

## What You Need
What you need is a fresh installation of an RDBMS such as MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle, etc. At the minimum, a text editor will help out a lot with the reading and interpreation of the SQL scripts within this project. Although installing and configuring your RDBMS of choice is beyond the initial scope of this project, check out the wiki for pointers and how-to guides on how to manage that important step.

## Practice Makes Perfect
Be prepared to make a lot of mistakes and to learn a lot along the way. The best way to learn is to set up your own instance of a database right away and to start coding in SQL to see how the output varies depending on the inputs put into the system in the form of SQL code. 

## What this project is NOT
This series of tutorials and scripts were not written as a start-to-finish sort of guide; it is instead intended to serve as a reference for starting to mid-level SQL and database professionals in a neverending quest to write precise, concise and elegant solutions to database problems encountered everywhere.
